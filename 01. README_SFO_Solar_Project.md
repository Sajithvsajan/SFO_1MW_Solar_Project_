# ☀️ SFO 1 MW Solar Canopy Project

This project presents the complete modeling, simulation, and financial analysis of a **1 MW utility-scale solar canopy system** at **San Francisco International Airport (SFO)**. It was developed using industry-grade tools like **HelioScope**, **PVsyst**, and **Microsoft Excel**, forming a core part of my energy engineering portfolio.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Location:** San Francisco International Airport (SFO)
- **System Size:** 1 MW DC / 900 kW AC
- **Modules:** 2502 × Jinko 400W
- **Inverters:** 9 × SMA
- **Annual Energy Production:** 1.58 GWh
- **Performance Ratio:** 87.1% (via PVsyst)
- **Tilt Angles Evaluated:** 15°, 25°, 35° (Selected: 15°)
- **Curtailment Scenario:** 80% export limitation simulated

## 📊 Financial Modeling Highlights

Built in Excel with 25-year financial projection:
- ✅ 30% Federal ITC
- ✅ MACRS 5-Year Accelerated Depreciation
- ✅ Escalating PPA revenue and annual O&M costs
- ✅ Degradation modeled at 0.5%/year
- ✅ Federal tax impact simulation

**Key Financial Metrics:**
- **IRR:** 12%  
- **LCOE:** $0.02/kWh
